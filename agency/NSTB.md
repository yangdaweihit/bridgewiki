## 历史

The NTSB originated in the Air Commerce Act of 1926, in which the
U.S. Congress charged the U.S. Department of Commerce with investigating
the causes of aircraft accidents. Later, that responsibility was given
to the Civil Aeronautics Board's Bureau of Aviation Safety, when it was
created in 1940.

In 1967, Congress consolidated all transportation agencies into a new
U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and established the NTSB as an
independent agency placed within the DOT for administrative purposes. In
creating the NTSB, Congress envisioned that a single organization with a
clearly defined mission could more effectively promote a higher level of
safety in the transportation system than the individual modal agencies
working separately. Since 1967, the NTSB has investigated accidents in
the aviation, highway, marine, pipeline, and railroad modes, as well as
accidents related to the transportation of hazardous materials.

In 1974, Congress reestablished the NTSB as a completely separate
entity, outside the DOT, reasoning that " ...No federal agency can
properly perform such (investigatory) functions unless it is totally
separate and independent from any other ... agency of the United
States. " Because the DOT has broad operational and regulatory
responsibilities that affect the safety, adequacy, and efficiency of the
transportation system, and transportation accidents may suggest
deficiencies in that system, the NTSB's independence was deemed
necessary for proper oversight. The NTSB, which has no authority to
regulate, fund, or be directly involved in the operation of any mode of
transportation, conducts investigations and makes recommendations from
an objective viewpoint.

In 1996, Congress assigned the NTSB the additional responsibility of
coordinating Federal assistance to families of aviation accident
victims. While originally legislated to provide assistance following
major aviation accidents, the program has expanded to provide assistance
in all modes of transportation on a case-by-case basis.  In 2000, the
agency embarked on a major initiative to increase employee technical
skills and make our investigative expertise more widely available to the
transportation community by establishing the NTSB Academy. The George
Washington University Virginia campus was selected as the Academy's
home. The NTSB took occupancy of the new facility in August 2003. On
October 1, 2006, the name of the NTSB Academy was changed to the NTSB
Training Center to better reflect the internal training mission of the
facility.

1996年，国会给予NSTB额外的责任，即帮助联邦照顾空难罹难者家庭。

从此，NSTB已调查了132,000个空难和数千陆上事故。每天24小时，每年365天，
NSTB调查员走遍全国和世界的每个角度，调查重大事故，完善事实记录和安全建议，
只有一个目的：确保事故不再发生。NSTB的交通安全提升头条清单强调了DOT
modal管理、 USCG，及其它部门需要采取的最重要安全措施，预防事故、拯救生命。

如今，NSTB已经向2500受众方发布了13,000安全建议。由于NSTB没有管理交通行业
的官方权威，其有效性完全源于声誉，这一声誉获取自进行全面、准确和独立的调
查，给出及时、考虑周到的提升交通安全的建议。
